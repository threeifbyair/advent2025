# Advent of Code 2025

It's that time of year again. While I complete last year's puzzles in CPP2 (I'm up to Day 23 now!) I'm going to keep it simple and do this one in Python. I thought of doing it in C++26 with reflection, or more CPP2, or Rust, or something else spicy, but I realized Python 'just works' and I'd rather take the easy way out this year.

Bring on the elves!
